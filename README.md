🛠️ INSTALLATION & SETUP
-----------------------
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/book-recommender.git
   cd book-recommender

2. Create virtual environment:
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install dependencies:
   pip install flask pandas numpy scikit-learn

4. Required CSV files:
   • Books.csv (Book information with ISBN, Title, Author, etc.)
   • Ratings.csv (User ratings with User-ID, ISBN, Book-Rating)
   • Users.csv (User information with User-ID, Location, Age)

5. Run the application:
   python app.py

6. Open browser and navigate to:
   http://localhost:5000

📊 DATASET REQUIREMENTS
----------------------
The system expects three CSV files:

Books.csv columns:
• ISBN (Primary key)
• Book-Title
• Book-Author
• Year-Of-Publication
• Publisher
• Image-URL-S, Image-URL-M, Image-URL-L

Ratings.csv columns:
• User-ID
• ISBN
• Book-Rating (1-10 scale)

Users.csv columns:
• User-ID
• Location
• Age

🔧 API ENDPOINTS
----------------
• GET /                    - Home page
• POST /recommend          - Get book recommendations
• GET /top-rated          - Display top rated books
• GET /api/book-suggestions - Autocomplete API for book titles

🎯 HOW IT WORKS
---------------
1. DATA PREPROCESSING:
   • Filters users with 50+ book ratings
   • Filters books with 50+ user ratings
   • Creates user-book rating matrix
   • Handles missing values and duplicates

2. RECOMMENDATION ENGINE:
   • Uses collaborative filtering approach
   • Calculates cosine similarity between books
   • Builds similarity matrix for instant recommendations
   • Returns top N similar books based on user input

3. ALGORITHMS USED:
   • Cosine Similarity for item-based collaborative filtering
   • Matrix Factorization using Truncated SVD
   • TF-IDF for content-based filtering (optional)

🚀 USAGE EXAMPLES
-----------------
1. Get recommendations for a book:
   Enter "Harry Potter" in the search box
   → System returns similar fantasy/adventure books

2. Browse top rated books:
   Visit /top-rated endpoint
   → Shows books with highest average ratings

3. API usage:
   GET /api/book-suggestions?q=harry
   → Returns JSON array of book titles containing "harry"

📈 PERFORMANCE METRICS
